What makes a checkmate:
    - All surround pieces from the king are under sightline of an enemy piece
    - The piece attacking the king cannot get captured
        - Discovered check
        - The piece that can attack it is unavaiable or pinned
        - If the king cannot capture it because it's protected by another piece
    - The piece that can move to block it are pinned

Check
    - If it's not a checkmate, the player can play any move which will be tested, and if it blocks the check, the it moves on else it asks for the move again
