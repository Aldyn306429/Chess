What to work on next:
    **Write tests for everything you worked on previously

    1) Add special cases in game_master.rb
        - Castling moves for kings and rooks
        - Promotions
        - Correct possible moves for new promotion pieces
        - Checkmate
        - No pieces left on the board to checkmate
        - If king is in check, you can only move a piece that will get the king out of check
            - Breaking the check, make king_in_check variable to equal false
    2) Add Players' names for user interface
    3) Add directions and rules
